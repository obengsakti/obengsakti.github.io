/*     NOTES:
 * [1] Number of list-items you want
 * [2] Size of closed menu "icon"
 * [3] Size of your expanded menu
 * [4] Size of the small units
 * [5] Used to transform the origin of the rotation on the list-itmes to the middle of the menu so they spin out in a centered circle. The same number also offsets position of the list items so they don't sit right on the edge of the actual <ul>, that way there's padding and the menu won't close down if the user moves their cursor a bit too far.
 * [6] Used for the degrees of rotation between each list item, keeping them all evenly spaced. 360 degrees in a circle divided by the number of list items you have
